## 🧪 Unit and E2E Tests

The project includes **unit** and **end-to-end (E2E)** tests using the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) framework to ensure quality and robustness.

- Unit tests cover business rules and isolated functions.
- E2E tests validate complete API flows, simulating real requests.
- To run the tests, use:

```sh
npm run test          # Run unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # Run E2E tests
```

Test files are located in the `test/` folder.

## 📄 Requests with client.http

The `client.http` file at the root of the project contains example HTTP requests to test and explore the API endpoints. You can use it with extensions like [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) in VS Code to quickly send requests during development.

---

## 📚 Swagger Documentation

The API provides interactive documentation generated by **Swagger**. To access it:

1. Start the server locally.
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000/api` in your browser.

There you can view all endpoints, parameters, responses, and test requests directly from the interface.
